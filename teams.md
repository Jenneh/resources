Hackathon Teams
---------------

This page is here to serve as a resource for those who want to participate
remotely, or join a team after the hackathon.

It will also serve as a way for teams to list themselves for presentations at
demo time!

Please use the format below to list your team, like so:


```

WideEyes
=============
WideEyes is an experimental AI that uses LUA to control gameboy color games.  Rather than attempt to complete the game, WideEyes focuses on exploration - he tries to make as much *stuff* happen as he can.
